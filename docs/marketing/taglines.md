## Short (Social Bios)
- "Production-grade push notifications for Node.js"
- "FCM + Expo + Queue + Retries = jxpush"
- "The missing push notification infrastructure for Node.js"

## Medium (Descriptions)
- "A unified push notification library that handles scalability, rate-limiting, and retries out of the box."
- "Stop building push infrastructure. jxpush handles FCM, Expo, queues, and retries in a single type-safe package."

## Long (Value Prop)
- "Most libraries just wrap the API. jxpush provides the infrastructure. With built-in queuing, concurrency control, and smart retries, it turns your Node.js app into a production-grade notification server."
